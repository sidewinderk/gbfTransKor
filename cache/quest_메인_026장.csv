English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,Rackam,"If that's the only hint we've got, we might as well follow it. C'mon, let's check it out!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,Pommern,Hahaha... You came. Just as I suspected you would.
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,???,"Ah, now here's a sight for sore eyes."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,Eugen,Looks like our mark was here after all.
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,Pommern,"Yes, but you won't be taking him. The prime minister herself entrusted him to me, you see."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s10,2641",detail,Pommern,First you'll have to go through my elite troops—the very pride of the Erste Empire!
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",synopsis,,"After [Djeeta] and the crew force Pommern into a corner, the imperial officer transforms using dark essence."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Vyrn,Those guys were s'posed to be your elite troops?
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Pommern,I cannot disappoint the prime minister...
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Pommern,"This is where I beat you at your own game, skyfarers!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Pommern,"And Lieutenant Katalina, make no<br>mistake—this is where I'll exact my revenge!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Rackam,"Ugh... Didn't you say the same kinda crap back in Auguste? Didn't matter then, and it doesn't matter now!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Katalina,"Don't underestimate him. He's using dark essence, so there's no telling what he's capable of."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Eugen,"Yeah, but on the other hand, it's like our target got a lot bigger."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s20,2642",detail,Eugen,"This'll be as easy as hittin' the broad side of an airship! Let's rumble, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",synopsis,,"[Djeeta] and the crew rescue the mysterious boy, who finally reveals his true nature."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Pommern,I suppose my body couldn't handle the dark essence when pushed to its limits...
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Katalina,Pommern! Don't you run! This is where I put an end to all of this!
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Pommern,What sheer foolishness!
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Katalina,Argh! My blade won't pierce him!
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Pommern,I will not die here! No way!
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Pommern,"Know this, treacherous insects! The next time we meet, your lives will be forfeit!"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,,"As Pommern turns tail and dashes away, the crew hurries over to the mysterious boy."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,"Thank you, Rackam. Oh, and [Djeeta] too. I knew that you would come to rescue me."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,"Yeah, well..."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,"Look, I gotta ask... How do we know each other?"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,Was it here? Did we meet here on Golonzo?
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,That's right. Golonzo is both where we met and where we made a promise.
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,"Huh. Well, if that's the truth, isn't it odd?"
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,"I mean, I came to Golonzo when I was just a little kid."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Rackam,But you're a kid now—how could we have met? You wouldn't have even been born yet.
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,"Haha. I believe you've misunderstood the situation, Rackam."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,Many moons and stars have passed while you've grown into an adult. That is certainly true.
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,"But for us immortal primal beasts, such a span of time is nothing more than an instant."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,"Nonetheless, I have been awaiting the day when you would keep your promise."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Katalina,What did you just say?
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Eugen,"If these ol' ears are still workin', I coulda sworn you said you're a primal beast..."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,???,"Ah, it seems I should introduce—well—reintroduce myself."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,Noa,"I am Noa, a primal beast who specializes in shipmaking and the creator of the Grandcypher."
English,"scene_cp26_q4_s30,2643",detail,,[Djeeta] and the crew find themselves at a loss for words as the boy reveals his true nature.
