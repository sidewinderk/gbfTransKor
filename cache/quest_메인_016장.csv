English,"scene_cp16_q2_s10,1621",detail,Rosetta,Aren't you forgetting something? Who was it that took Orchis from the Black Knight's airship in the first place?
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s10,1621",detail,Rosetta,"If she wants to leave Lumacie, she'll have to use that airship."

English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rosetta,Just a teensy bit further... so long as we don't run into any monsters.

English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,"We're chasing after the Black Knight because she took Orchis, right?"
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,But wasn't it our plan to return Orchis to her in the first place?
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,Isn't it safe to say we already accomplished our mission?
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,I'm not sure it's wise to keep sticking our noses where they don't belong at this point.

English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,And what do we do after we get Orchis back? Take her with us?
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,I'm pretty sure they call that kidnapping. Stop me if I'm wrong...

English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,Sorry about that... But I don't want to let Orchis go either. Lyria and I are on the same page.

English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rackam,What if we're just marching straight to our deaths?
English,"scene_cp16_q2_s20,1622",detail,Rosetta,"I have a soft spot for recklessness... It's a better choice than cowardice, anyway."
