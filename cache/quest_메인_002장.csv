English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,Listen here. The sky's done with me so I'm done with the sky. That's all there is to it.

English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,You're not wrong. It lifted me up and threw me back down to the ground just as quickly.
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Lyria,You crashed... Is that why you gave up on flying?
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,Yeah... Felt like I was betrayed.
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,I had an expert technician handle repairs and worked like mad to get my piloting skills up to speed. I just knew I was ready...

English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,Ha-ha! Didn't they tell ya? I was a real ace of a helmsman!
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,I had no doubt in my ability... until the sky betrayed me.
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s10,211",detail,Rackam,"Anyway, the time for talk is over. We gotta go warn the town the empire's coming."

English,"scene_cp2_q1_s20,212",detail,Rackam,But I'm not sticking my neck out for anything but that airship of mine... the Grandcypher.
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s20,212",detail,Katalina,So you're saying... a ship's more important to you than the lives of innocent people?
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s20,212",detail,Rackam,What I'm saying is I only protect what's dear to me. I'm not about to die fighting the empire.
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s20,212",detail,Rackam,Watch out or those bleeding hearts of yours are gonna leave you bleeding out. Literally!
English,"scene_cp2_q1_s20,212",detail,Katalina,There are lives at stake! How can you just ignore them when they're right in front of you?

English,"scene_cp2_q2_s20,222",detail,Lyria,But the people of that town helped us back at Siero's shop when we needed it most.
English,"scene_cp2_q2_s20,222",detail,Katalina,"Indeed. We owe them a lot. And there's no better way to pay them back than by stopping the empire in its tracks, [Djeeta]."
