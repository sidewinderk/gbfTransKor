English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",synopsis,,"[Djeeta] and company land near the old mines. As the company battles its way through the monsters of the desert, Io talks about Archduke Tzaka."
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Rackam,Landing complete... And mooring successful. That shouldn't have called too much attention to us.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Katalina,The empire knows people don't come here for the scenery. We should assume they're on to us.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Rackam,"Sand, rocks, and more sand... Is that all there is in Valtz?"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,"[Djeeta], I know we just sort of ended up here, but you have to be strong if you're fighting the empire. You... <span class='scene-font-italic'>are</span> strong, right?"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Lyria,"Don't worry, Io! [Djeeta], Katalina, and Rackam are all super strong!"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,If you say so... I suppose it's fine.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Lyria,"Hey, Io, what kind of person is the archduke?"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,"Well... he's sloppy, slobby, and forgetful. But he has a heart of gold."
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,He truly believes that magic exists to make people happy. And you can tell from the way he uses his abilities.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Katalina,Sounds like he's quite the jolly fellow... I hope it's not long before we meet.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,"Yeah, but I'm warning you that he's really not one to sweat the details!"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,The first time he showed me his magic he kept calling it a secret spell. But thinking back... it was just a simple magic trick.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,"I was incredibly sad about something at the time, but that cheap little trick made me smile from ear to ear."
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s10,621",detail,Io,That's when I decided... I was going to be like him someday.
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",synopsis,,"Surrounded by desert monsters, [Djeeta] and company attempt to protect Io in battle, but she insists on fighting as a proud magical disciple of the archduke."
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Rackam,Whoops... Looks like this is no time for chitchat!
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Katalina,Something feels different here... We've got monsters!
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Vyrn,"Hey, [Djeeta]! There are monsters coming from over here too!"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Lyria,"This way, Io! You can hide over here!"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Io,"I'll be fine. I'm a mage, you know. I can wipe the floor with a monster or two any day!"
English,"scene_cp6_q2_s20,622",detail,Rackam,"Don't go biting off more than you can chew, kiddo!"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",synopsis,,"After discovering the entrance to an abandoned mine, [Djeeta] and company are filled with determination to find the archduke."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Vyrn,"Over here! They tried really hard to hide it, but it looks like this is the entrance to some abandoned mines!"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Katalina,"From here on out, we're entering enemy territory. Io, this could be dangerous. You have to be careful..."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,O-okay! But I'm still a mage. I won't hold you back.
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Katalina,"Io, what are you going to do if we find your master here?"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,First I'll wallop him!
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Katalina,Huh?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,Knowing his talent he might just be working on something awesome to blow you all away.
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,But that doesn't excuse him for teaming up with the empire and vanishing. How's an apprentice supposed to feel about that?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,"I don't know what the archduke is thinking, but we're taking him back with us... even if it means dealing out a beatdown first!"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Vyrn,"Whoa, that sounds pretty extreme!"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,I mean... how could he run away and not say anything to his apprentice about it? I've been worried sick about him...
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,He's supposed to be my master... and I'm supposed to be his apprentice... Sniff...
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,Waaah!
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Rackam,"C-could you spare me the waterworks? Katalina! Lyria! Do something, will ya?"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,Maaaster! Waaahh!
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Katalina,"There, there, Io. You've been a real trooper. I know you've been holding it in all this time."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Lyria,"(Hey, what about me?)"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Rackam,Sigh... This is exactly why I can't stand kids.
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,Excuse me? What did you just say?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Rackam,"Not a word, Your Highness."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Vyrn,"Just you wait, Io! Me and [Djeeta] have things under control. Just leave it to us!"
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s10,631",detail,Io,"Okay... I dunno about the lizard, but I'm counting on you, [Djeeta]. Please... find my master."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",synopsis,,[Djeeta] and company are chilled to discover a sprawling research facility deep in the mine. They contemplate what research the archduke might have taken part in.
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Vyrn,This looks like the end of the line!
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Rackam,What in the world is this place? Are they doing some kind of research here?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Io,And has my master been helping them out here?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",sel1_txt,,Maybe they were researching the primals?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",sel2_txt,,Maybe they were researching ore?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Rackam,So wait... Was the archduke of Valtz researching the same stuff as the empire?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Rackam,"I guess it's not out of the question, but the magic left behind by the Astrals is some seriously scary stuff..."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Rackam,And why would the empire need to hide out here to do research?
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Rackam,"Whatever they've been doing here, they definitely didn't want anyone finding out."
English,"scene_cp6_q3_s20,632",detail,Vyrn,"Hey, this is no time to chat! We've gotta deal with these monsters!"

English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Katalina,"I should have known... What are you doing here, Black Knight?"
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Katalina,What business would one of the Seven Luminary Knights and top adviser to the Erste Empire have here?
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,That is for me to decide... along with the fate of the world. Now know your place and close that insolent mouth of yours.
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Io,An imperial knight? Tell me where my master is!
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,"What a plucky little brat. I presume you speak of Archduke Tzaka? I know he's not here, but little more."
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Io,"Don't lie to me! You guys kidnapped him, didn't you?"
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,"You need to learn how to address your betters, little girl. As for the archduke... I'm searching for him myself."
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,"The archduke proposed this collaborative research project to the empire, but suddenly withdrew his support and disappeared."
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,"I'd be careful if I were you. The archduke is trying to create something terrifying, and to do so he needs this doll... and Lyria."

English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Katalina,"The archduke is targeting Lyria, you say?"
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,Yes. His Excellency seemed obsessed with something when I last held an audience with him.
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,He had this truly awful look on his face. His eyes were completely bloodshot and yet strangely full of energy.
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,Primal crystal technology... The archduke was clinging to it. Lyria will be targeted just like my doll.
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Rackam,"More mechanical monsters just showed up, [Djeeta]! They must have come in from the entrance."
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,Speak of the devil. The archduke wastes no time...
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s10,641",detail,Black Knight,You share Lyria's fate... Which means we shall meet again. May you be spared a meaningless death.

English,"scene_cp6_q4_s20,642",detail,Io,"If what she was saying is true, my master must have created those machines. But why? Why would he do such a thing?"
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s20,642",detail,Rackam,"Calm your pigtails, kiddo! You're not about to believe what some suspicious knight has to say, are you?"
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s20,642",detail,Io,But... I can feel it! There are traces of his magic on those machines!
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s20,642",detail,Rackam,Say what?
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s20,642",detail,Io,"I could feel it ever so slightly last time it attacked us too. I didn't want to believe it, but..."

English,"scene_cp6_q4_s30,643",synopsis,,"Despite emerging victorious, Io is crushed that her voice no longer seems capable of reaching the archduke. But Lyria notices a slight change from the mechanical monster and consoles Io."
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s30,643",detail,Vyrn,Everyone okay? Those guys were pretty tough!
English,"scene_cp6_q4_s30,643",detail,Rackam,Is Io all right?
