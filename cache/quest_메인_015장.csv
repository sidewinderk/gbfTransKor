English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",synopsis,,"With no clues to the Black Knight's whereabouts, [Djeeta] and the others decide to search the ruins."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Orchis,"I'm sorry. That scent seemed familiar, but following it got you into trouble..."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Katalina,"No need to apologize. We're the ones who decided to follow it, after all."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Vyrn,Exactly! And that golem didn't have a chance against us anyway!
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Rackam,What kind of place is this though? I mean... why does a golem need to keep watch over it?
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Rackam,"Based on the remains, it looks like this place used to be an ordinary chapel."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Rosetta,Is it possible the golem and these ruins aren't necessarily related?
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Rosetta,"What if a mage happened upon this place, chose to hide treasure here, and created a golem to guard it?"
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Io,Hidden treasure? I like the sound of that!
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Vyrn,"And it's gotta be finders keepers! Let's take a look around, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Io,Ah! Hey! Wait up!
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Rosetta,Although I highly doubt a mage would hide their treasure in a place like this...
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Katalina,Let's just take a look around for now. Orchis and Lyria might find something that connects them to this place.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Lyria,"Yeah! Let's go, Orchis!"
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Orchis,"Okay. You should come with us, [Djeeta]..."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s10,1521",detail,Lyria,Sounds good to me! We can all search together!
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",synopsis,,"[Djeeta] and the others search the ruins high and low, but find nothing of interest. They decide to set out again to find the Black Knight."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Vyrn,<span class='scene-font-italic'>Huff...</span> And here I was all fired up about finding some treasure...
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Io,There's... <span class='scene-font-italic'>Huff...</span> Nothing here...
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Katalina,You two did your fair share of rushing around!
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Orchis,Lyria. Did you find anything?
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Lyria,No. Not a thing...
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Lyria,"But to be honest, I don't really recognize the scent you were talking about either."
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Katalina,Then that may mean your powers aren't especially related.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Katalina,Orchis could've just smelled something that reminded her of home.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Eugen,"Speaking of which, where are you from, Orchis? Lumacie?"
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Orchis,I don't know. My earliest memory is of being with Apollo.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Orchis,But... this isn't my home. It just... doesn't feel like it.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Eugen,In that case we could just stroll about the area until yer satisfied.
English,"scene_cp15_q2_s20,1522",detail,Eugen,The Black Knight is bound to show up again if we ramble around the forest some more... and take care of some monsters along the way.
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",synopsis,,"Lyria notices that Orchis has disappeared. Believing her to be lost, [Djeeta] and the crew begin to search for her."

English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",detail,Vyrn,Hm? You think she might've gotten lost?
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",detail,Lyria,Maybe... She was here just a second ago.
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",detail,Io,She's gotten herself lost already? Might as well get her a babysitter!
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",detail,Rackam,Didn't you get lost just a second ago?
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s10,1531",detail,Io,Wh-whatever! I don't wanna hear it! Let's just find her—and quick!
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",synopsis,,"With Orchis still missing, [Djeeta] and the crew begin to worry. Rosetta reveals that she may know something about Vyrn's past, but quickly changes the subject when monsters appear."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Lyria,Hm... I don't see Orchis anywhere.
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Katalina,This is certainly worrisome. I hope no monsters got to her.
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,"She seemed strong enough to handle herself, but I don't like the idea of her being out here alone."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,How about we cook up somethin' tasty? The smells might lure her out!
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Io,"I'm not sure about that, Vyrn. She's not a lizard like you..."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,I'm <span class='scene-font-italic'>not</span> a lizard!
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,You aren't?
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,"Oh, c'mon! Don't act so surprised!"
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,"With these awesome wings and fearsome claws, does anything about me scream <span class='scene-font-italic'>lizard</span> to you?"
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Katalina,"Round wings and little claws... They're kind of adorable, Vyrn."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,Hey! Don't call me cute!
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,"Ah, you're right! You're not a lizard...<br>And you never were..."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,Duh! I've never been a lizard! I was born like this.
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Vyrn,"Wait, what do you mean <span class='scene-font-italic'>never were</span>? Did we meet before in the past or something?"
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,P-perhaps... Who knows? And what would it matter?
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,"You have more important things to concern yourself with. Like these monsters! Ready yourself, [Djeeta]."
English,"scene_cp15_q3_s20,1532",detail,Rosetta,"If we get walloped by monsters here, Orchis will never let us live it down!"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",synopsis,,"The crew searches the forest for Orchis, but the Black Knight finds her first. Orchis wishes to stay with [Djeeta] and the crew, but the Black Knight takes her away. The crew decides to pursue them."

English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Eugen,No sign of her after all this searching... And it's startin' to get dangerous around here too.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Eugen,Hopefully she made it back to Siero's on her own.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,???,You're certainly optimistic.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Orchis,...
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Rackam,The Black Knight!
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Lyria,Orchis! So you were with the Black Knight all along?
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Orchis,...
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Lyria,"What's wrong, Orchis?"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,"Just what were you trying to pull, Rosetta?"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Rosetta,I didn't mean anything by it. I just took a liking to the girl. Nothing more.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,"Such foolishness... But so be it. I have her back now, so I'll overlook your transgressions... this time."
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Rosetta,"Is that right? Then I'll try to be more careful in the future, I guess."
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,Tch... We're leaving.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Orchis,...
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,What's going on with you? Out with it.
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Orchis,I... I want to stay with Lyria and the others. For just a little longer...
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,"Is this what you were after, Rosetta? With all your troublesome meddling?"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Rosetta,Perhaps... Who knows?
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Vyrn,"Hold on a second, Black Knight! Are you gonna pretend like we're not standing right here?"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Vyrn,"You told us to come to Lumacie, but all we've found is trees and more trees!"
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,Fool... Is that all you can see around you?
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s10,1541",detail,Black Knight,"Come, little doll. We're done here."

English,"scene_cp15_q4_s20,1542",detail,Orchis,Io...
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s20,1542",detail,Black Knight,You're a stubborn bunch... Who are you to tell me what I can do with my property?

English,"scene_cp15_q4_s20,1542",detail,Rackam,Huh? Excuse me?
English,"scene_cp15_q4_s20,1542",detail,Black Knight,All of the help and advice I've given you until now was for ensuring Lyria's safe journey.
