English,"scene_evt190627_cp4_q3_s10,7428431",detail,Oceanographer,Definitely not.

English,"scene_evt190627_cp4_q3_s10,7428431",detail,Oceanographer,I can't count how many times he was late when we had plans... Like I should be honored even to spend time with a hero like him. He treated me like just another fan.

English,"scene_evt190627_cp4_q3_s10,7428431",detail,Malluel,But Old Bruce was his enemy for years and years. I can see how he'd get a bit carried away after finally winning.
