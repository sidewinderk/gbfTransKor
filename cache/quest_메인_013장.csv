English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Katalina,Eek! What was that? A bug?
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Katalina,Get back here! You'll be a stain on my sword when I'm through!
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Rackam,Calm down! It's just a little critter. Now what do you know about Lumacie?
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Katalina,Oh! Well... nothing really. I've only heard the name here and there.
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Katalina,But they say Lumacie has been forgotten by the world. And supposedly... a scarlet demon calls the islands home.
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Rackam,Hold on a second! Have we been roped into a demon exorcism gig?
English,"scene_cp13_q1_s20,1312",detail,Io,Humph... Not much different from what we've been doing!
