English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Eugen,"Great, just great... Another higher-up of the Erste Empire comes out to welcome us."
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Gandharva,Hah hah hah! Actually I was called in on business and just happened to be around!
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Gandharva,But what a great chance this is. Care to play a little?
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Rosetta,Unfortunately we have no time for games and must be on our way.
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Gandharva,You can't possibly be thinking of leaving so soon after leaping into the arms of your enemy.
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Gandharva,I'm not interested in the army's business. Just let me have a little fun!
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Vyrn,Darn it! Don't tell me we gotta take another detour!
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Lyria,Oh no... It doesn't look like we're getting any closer to the Grandcypher...
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s10,5631",detail,Eugen,"No point standin' here complainin'! Let's get a move on, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",synopsis,,Gandharva realizes that Lecia is not present and loses interest in the pursuit. [Djeeta] and the others use this chance to get away.

English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Lyria,"If you mean Lecia, she's not with us right now."
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Gandharva,Huh? What a letdown...
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Gandharva,"Ah, whatever...<br>Hey. I'll let you guys decide what to do."
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Imperial Soldier,"Lieutenant General? If we don't take this seriously again, the prime minister will..."
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Gandharva,So what? [Djeeta]'s the only one that seems worth fighting anyway...
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Io,H-he's not even hiding the fact he's lost interest...
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Rosetta,That's quite rude of him. Is Lecia of that much interest to him?
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Eugen,"Better than being chased by him when he's at full tilt, right?"
English,"scene_cp56_q3_s20,5632",detail,Eugen,Ain't no problem if it's just those soldiers to contend with. Let's break through!

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s10,5641",detail,Vyrn,This isn't good... They're cutting off our escape routes bit by bit!
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s10,5641",detail,Rosetta,It sure looks that way... Those two generals make a surprisingly good team.
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s10,5641",detail,Io,"Oh, come on! Bad guys showing off their teamwork sucks for us!"
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s10,5641",detail,Imperial Soldier,Surrender at once! Don't cause us anymore trouble!

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Furias,You've given us quite the run around. Has it given you time to prepare for the consequences?

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Io,"Humph! If there's nowhere to run, we'll just have to fight! I'm not gonna lose like this!"
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Rosetta,"That's easy to say, but we're a little outnumbered here. What won't be easy is breaking out."

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,???,It would take a miracle for someone of your stature to finish me off. A miracle that won't fall in your lap.
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Furias,"Damn you! You always knew how to piss me off, <span class='scene-font-italic'>Miss Chief</span> Advisor!"

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Black Knight,Yes. This is much better than being half-dressed.
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Gandharva,You're kidding me. Now the Black Knight's shown up too.
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Gandharva,This won't do. Get away from me. I'll take her—
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Katalina,I see. Then we'll take the liberty of breaking through from this side.

English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Furias,"Huh? What's that, you say? I'm sorry, but I don't understand you!"
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Furias,Or what? Should I torture to death an old fart like you instead of them?
English,"scene_cp56_q4_s20,5642",detail,Gandharva,Hah! Let's make it first come first serve then! Sounds fair to me!
