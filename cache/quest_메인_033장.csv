English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Io,"Hey, I asked this back in Amalthea, but why would Freesia stay in such a rundown city?"
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Io,There aren't even any soldiers on guard here. Is there anything in this city worth protecting?
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Black Knight,There's nothing. That's the advantage of this location.
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Black Knight,"However, I have a good reason to believe she's here."
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Black Knight,"While the Erste Empire means nothing to Freesia, the Erste Kingdom, on the other hand, is everything to her."
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Io,Huh? Isn't she supposed to be the prime minister of the empire?
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Black Knight,"She is now, yes. But before that she was a consul for the monarchy."
English,"scene_cp33_q2_s20,3322",detail,Black Knight,"Previously her clan had served the Erste royal family for generations, millennia even."

English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Katalina,There have been so many monsters but zero soldiers since we've landed.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Katalina,And ordinarily you'd expect soldiers to take care of any that make their way through the streets.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,Any troops that are stationed here now aren't here for the city's protection.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,At least it's not the city's people they're protecting—but rather it's the city's secrets.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,"Which is also the true purpose of the battleships circling the island. Not only do they prevent anyone from trespassing, they keep anyone from leaving."
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Lyria,How awful... So the people here...
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,They can't leave this island. At least not without the empire's permission.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,"That being said, I've never heard of such permission having ever been granted."
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Katalina,Are you suggesting the empire has just abandoned the people of this city? Left them to survive with no support?
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,...
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Black Knight,Yes. There's no reason to make excuses.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s10,3331",detail,Katalina,You heartless—

English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Io,Obviously. We're stuck with the Black Knight after all.

English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,No need for apologies. She made her own path.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Eugen,Even so—I'm her father.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,So that means you have to take responsibility for everything she's done?

English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,"Even if she didn't directly do these things, like the archduke would suggest, well..."
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,She certainly didn't stop them from happening. She left so many people out to dry. Will you atone for her crimes?
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Eugen,That's not what I meant...
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,Hehe. Sorry for teasing you.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,But you know the Black Knight is no longer a child.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,In fact she hasn't been a child for quite some time. It seems silly to try parenting her now that she's accomplished so much.
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,"Well whether her accomplishments were for better or worse, she's experienced enough to be an adult several times over."

English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rackam,"Rosetta, I keep tryin' to figure you out, but who are you really?"
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rackam,Givin' life advice like that—don't tell me you're actually older than Eugen?
English,"scene_cp33_q3_s20,3332",detail,Rosetta,"Didn't you ever learn that it's rude to ask a lady her age? Hehe, the nerve..."
