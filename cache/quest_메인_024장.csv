English,"scene_cp24_q1_s20,2412",detail,Io,"That's nice and all, but we've got some monsters to take care of! I'll get them in one sweep!"
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",synopsis,,"Lyria says she can help find the real Celeste. With Sturm and Drang fully on board with the plan, [Djeeta] and the crew attack the swarm of monsters approaching."
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Rosetta,We've fought through a lot of monsters now... I think we should start looking for the real Celeste.
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Lyria,"If we're looking for a primal beast, then leave the search to me!"
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Lyria,The real Celeste should be giving off a strong aura!
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Sturm,Sounds like you're the right person for the job... So leave the monsters to us.
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Drang,"Oh-ho-ho, what's this? Even Sturm is starting to get into the chase—ow!"
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s10,2421",detail,Sturm,"Look, it's either all in or nothing for me. So let's do it, [Djeeta]. Let's get these monsters standing in our way!"
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",synopsis,,"Lyria is unable to find any clear signs of Celeste because of the mist. Suddenly a ghostly Celeste appears and eats a zombie to regain power. Worried about the villagers, Ferry runs off on her own."
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Lyria,"Oh no... I'm so sorry, [Djeeta]. I don't think I can find Celeste..."
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Vyrn,Say what! What does that mean?
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Lyria,Its aura is spread all over the island because of the mist... I just can't find the real Celeste.
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Katalina,Then we're in trouble. Searching with the naked eye is no good in this thick fog...
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Celeste,...
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Io,H-hey! What's it doing? Are my eyes fooling me?
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Lyria,It's... eating a zombie!
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Rosetta,Zombies and ghosts... Maybe it's trying to restore power by eating creatures like itself.
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Vyrn,Hold on just a minute! Doesn't that mean the villagers are in danger?
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Ferry,!
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Katalina,Wait! Ferry! Where are you going? You'll be in danger!
English,"scene_cp24_q2_s20,2422",detail,Io,We're already in danger! Monsters are coming! And they'll get you if you're careless!

English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Lyria,It's Ferry! And look who else!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Villager 1,Need some help? Leave it to us!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Villager 2,Ferry told us everything. We want to help.
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Ferry,"I brought the villagers. If we have to search, then together we should be able to cover the entire island!"
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Ferry,This is our island. And that's our enemy. We won't just sit around!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Vyrn,"Well that's a big help! Right, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Katalina,I can't think of better allies than the very people who know this island by heart.
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s10,2431",detail,Vyrn,"All right! Let's get rid of these annoying monsters and be on our way! Come on, [Djeeta]!"

English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Ferry,"Yes... Ah, I see. Thanks!"
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Ferry,Lyria! [Djeeta]! A ghost ship was spotted near that cliff in the distance!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Katalina,"We finally found it! However, it might be difficult to get there right away..."
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Monster,Groarrr!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Rosetta,"It would seem that unless we do something about this little one, we can't pass through here."
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Vyrn,And there's no telling when Celeste will drop the anchor on the villagers!
English,"scene_cp24_q3_s20,2432",detail,Vyrn,So let's pummel this thing and get going!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",synopsis,,"[Djeeta] and the others hurry toward the cliff where Celeste is hiding. Ferry is grateful the villagers helped them find the primal beast, and is determined fight for them until the end."

English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Ferry,I see now! It was trying to hide in the shadow of the cliff.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Rosetta,It would've been impossible to find in a place like that without lots of people searching.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Lyria,"We did it all thanks to you, Ferry!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Ferry,It's not me but the villagers you should be thanking. They're the reason we could find her.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Ferry,Surely nothing would've been accomplished if I'd acted alone...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Ferry,But it's not over yet! We have to stay sharp.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s10,2441",detail,Katalina,"I'm with you on this one. [Djeeta], time to focus!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",synopsis,,"[Djeeta] and the crew find the real Celeste, but Sturm and Drang have disappeared again. Ferry thanks [Djeeta] and makes one last wish that order be restored to the island."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Celeste,...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Vyrn,"That's the real Celeste, all right... Whoa! Did Sturm and Drang wander off somewhere again?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Katalina,Who knows? Maybe they decided they'd fulfilled their obligations.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Katalina,"After all, those two played a great deal in getting us this far."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Ferry,We certainly couldn't have pulled this off if I'd stayed shut in the mansion...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Ferry,"Thank you, Lyria and [Djeeta]. I'm very grateful for what you've done."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Lyria,"Oh, Ferry... Save your thanks until we actually get all this taken care of!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Io,"Ha! As long as I'm around, there's no way we can lose!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Rosetta,It would be a real shame if we came this far only to be beaten.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Vyrn,"So we're gonna settle this once and for all! Right, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Ferry,"I'll make one last wish, [Djeeta]..."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s20,2442",detail,Ferry,Please... Restore order to this island!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",synopsis,,"Celeste is defeated and the villagers disappear. But Ferry remains, saying that she still has a part to play in this world. Drang reveals to Sturm his true purpose for coming to the island."

English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,I've absorbed Celeste's power...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Vyrn,Look! The mist has faded and sunlight is breaking through!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,"In the next moment, the villagers turn to sand."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,"But a bright, beaming smile can be seen on each of their faces as they disappear."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,Well... I guess it's my turn soon.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,"Yeah... It was nice meeting you, Ferry."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,"We were together only a short time, but you helped me so much. Now... I must go somewhere far away..."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,"If we should meet again decades or centuries from now, I'd love to hear of all your adventures."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,Okay...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Vyrn,Y-you... take care of yourself over there...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,"After saying her goodbyes, Ferry closes her eyes and waits quietly to fade."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,But some time passes and Ferry has yet to disappear.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Vyrn,"Hey, what's going on? All our weepy goodbyes were for nothin'!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,"No need to fuss, Vyrn! As long as she's still here, who cares why?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Katalina,"But still, what does it all mean? There don't seem to be any people still around..."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,No... She's gone for sure. That nameless ghost who shut her heart from others...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,Here stands a new me with a new name.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,I still have a part to play. So I remain here in this world and I'm not going away.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,That sounds like reason enough to me!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,I guess you're going to have to wait a little while longer before you can reunite with your family though.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,"Yeah... But through all this, I discovered something wonderful."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,So a reunion with my family will keep being something to look forward to in the future.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Lyria,Wait... You discovered something wonderful?
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Ferry,That's right. And that discovery was just what I needed!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,"Drang, just tell me already... What were you trying to achieve back there?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,"You knew from the beginning that Celeste had no treasure, right?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"All right, I'll come clean... You see, I've always had a soft spot for my granny."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,Excuse me?
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,And she came from a small island that was enshrouded by mist all year round...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"But she was sickly as a child, so she left her family to get treatment. Moved to a whole other island..."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"She tried returning to her home once she was well, but somehow... she couldn't get near the island."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,You're kidding me... Her misty-island homeland was...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"She'd been living apart from her dear big sister the whole time, you see."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,So Granny was always worried about her.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"When I was a kid, she'd tell me all about her big sister. And I always wanted to meet her, if only once."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,I see... So that's why you came.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,Well? How do you feel now you've met her?
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,She's as adorable as Granny said!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,But If I could... I would've liked to have seen an old biddy... All wrinkly like Granny.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,Well...
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,All right! That's enough of the sob stories!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"So, Sturm, where are we off to next?"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,It wouldn't hurt to go to Auguste for a vacation!
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,Too bad. That's going to have to wait since we've got another mission.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"Oh, we'll just blow it off! Good, that settles it! Let's hit the beach and—ow!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Sturm,"In our line of work, trust is paramount. Now, come on..."
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,Drang,"Wait, Sturm! Wait! Don't leave me here!"
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,[Djeeta] and the crew set off again for Golonzo to have the Grandcypher repaired.
English,"scene_cp24_q4_s30,2443",detail,,"But on that island, a more curious encounter awaits them."
