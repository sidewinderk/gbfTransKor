English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Vyrn,Huh? Then what are we supposed to do?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,Don't you worry. We just need to calm Tiamat down a bit. Right?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Lyria,Yes. I'm sure I can do something after that.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,"In that case, it's our turn to act."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Katalina,"What in the world are you planning, Rackam? It's too dangerous! Don't go anywhere near Tiamat!"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Lyria,"Wait, Katalina! Let's let Rackam handle this!"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,"Hey, Tiamat. We heard all about it. The reason you went on a rampage, that is."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,Heard you're the one responsible for blessing Port Breeze with these winds...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Tiamat,My... winds...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,I've gotta apologize. I always thought you were a myth. Never gave you the thanks you deserve.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,That being said... there are some things we just can't give up.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,There are things I want to protect... That I have to protect. So I'm not backing down anymore.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,"I'm not gonna run, and I'm not gonna hide. Neither of us can afford to compromise, can we?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Tiamat,...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,So we're gonna have to butt heads... with everything we've got!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Rackam,Let's do this fair and square! Whether you're a god or a primal beast or whatever! No holding back!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s20,442",detail,Tiamat,Gragh... Raghhh!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",synopsis,,"After Tiamat is defeated, Rackam decides to become the helmsman for [Djeeta] and the others. Sierokarte gives the newly formed crew a letter that says to go to the Valtz Duchy."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Whew!<br>Not bad. Not bad at all...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Lyria,Everything's going to be all right. I absorbed Tiamat's overflowing energy.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Lyria,She should return to her senses now.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,"Lyria, what's that in your hand?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Lyria,Huh? Where did this come from?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,That's a piece of the sky map!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,"It's just like the one your dad had, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,So this is a sky map piece? With this we can keep Lyria out of the empire's grasp...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Hey! The sky's cleared up!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,"The sun shines through the gaps in the clouds, illuminating the Grandcypher as if heaven itself has given its blessing."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,"Whew. Nice work, [Djeeta]. I'd say we've earned ourselves a break."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,So where do you guys wanna go?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,Oh? Does this mean you'll take us with you?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,"Sure, why not? No place better than the skies, I figure."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,"And with you guys around, something tells me I won't part with the skies again."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,"Besides, the Grandcypher seems to have taken a liking to you, [Djeeta]."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Leave it to me and I'll take you anywhere you wanna go! Even the end of the sky!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,"With a helmsman having joined them, [Djeeta] and a newly formed crew set a course for the farthest reaches of the sky."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,"While flying over the town, [Djeeta] spots a tiny figure waving from the ground."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,"Hm? Well, if it isn't Sierokarte!"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Siero? What's she got in her hand?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,She may need something from us. Let's go down and hear what she has to say.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Sierokarte,Oh goodness! You've been an enormous help to everyone!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,"Well, we couldn't exactly turn a blind eye to the empire's injustice."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,"Anyway, we saw you waving at us. Did you need something?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Sierokarte,"Oh, that's right! I received a letter addressed to [Djeeta], you see!"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Lyria,"A letter? Is it from your hometown, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Sierokarte,Nope! A somewhat suspicious duo delivered it by hand.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Sierokarte,They said they absolutely had to return a favor...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Return a favor? Then I bet it's from those two.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,Who knows? Let's open it and find out!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,The letter couldn't be shorter.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,"Go to the Valtz Duchy, it says...<br>What's this about?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,The Valtz Duchy? It's a nearby Draph island known for its booming steel industry.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,"If they're trying to return a favor, I guess that means there's something good waiting for us over there."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,Should we go to Valtz then?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Katalina,I don't know. Can we really afford to trust those two?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Lyria,"They do seem a little suspicious, but doesn't the letter make you curious?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Vyrn,"Well yeah! This message is cryptic. You're curious too, right, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Rackam,Then it's decided! We'll let our curiosity guide us through the sky!
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,"Having settled on the next destination, [Djeeta] and the crew set off for the Valtz Duchy."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,,Another tale of the sky and stars waits for [Djeeta] there...
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Sturm,"And that's all. We entrusted the letter to the Knickknack Shack, as per your instructions."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,???,Good work.<br>Now Drang... How does Furias seem to be faring?
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,Drang,"No problems that I've seen! My, dark essence certainly is something to behold, isn't it?"
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,???,"Naturally. Its use comes at a cost, however..."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,???,Everything is going according to plan. It's only a matter of time now.
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,???,"I'll get you back no matter what. Just hold on a little longer for me, Orchis..."
English,"scene_cp4_q4_s30,443",detail,???,...
