English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Lyria,It's true that I've met all kinds of primal beasts...
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Lyria,But this is probably my first time chatting with one face to face.
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Rackam,"So, Lyria, does that mean you can sense he's a primal beast?"
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Lyria,Umm... Maybe a little... Just a faint bit...
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Lyria,"Oh, but I think I've felt something like this before..."
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Rackam,I see...
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,"Come now, are you having doubts about who I am?"
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Rackam,"Well, from what you've told us so far, it's pretty hard to just accept it at face value."
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,"Oh my... What if I told you I could prove that I knew you when you were young, Rackam?"
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Eugen,Oh? How so?
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,Haha. This story goes way back to when our friendship was first formed...
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,"Rackam, you got separated from Eugen. You were lost on an unfamiliar island, crying in a lonely back alley."
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Rackam,W-wait a second! What's the way I cried got to do with anything?
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,I thought that if I faithfully detailed what you were like as a child then you would come to believe me.
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Noa,It was adorable... You were desperately calling Eugen's name while sobbing...
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Rackam,Okay! Fine! You definitely met me when I was a child!
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Io,"Judging from how upset he's made you, you can tell he must be telling the truth."
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Imperial Soldier,There! I heard a loud voice coming from over there!
English,"scene_cp27_q1_s20,2712",detail,Katalina,"They've found our location. Everyone, draw your weapons."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",synopsis,,The crew confirms that the Grandcypher can't leave Golonzo until Rackam keeps his promise to Noa.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,"I'm relieved you've begun to believe me, but why do you look so pale?"
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Rackam,Could it have something to do with a certain loose-lipped primal beast?
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Rackam,"But, yeah, can't deny that we've met before."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,"Well, of course we have. I never had a reason to lie to you or your friends."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Vyrn,So that means it's true that the Grandcypher can't leave the island right now?
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,"Yes. Until the promise has been fulfilled, the Grandcypher isn't budging."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Io,You've been talking an awful lot about this promise. What is it anyway?
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,A promise is a promise. And Rackam made a special one with me on that day.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Rackam,I did?
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,So you've forgotten. Unfortunately I'm not able to tell you the particulars of this promise.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Noa,But that's just fine. I know you'll find a way to remember.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s10,2721",detail,Katalina,"That's all well and good, but we should get a move on. The empire's search party will be close by now. We need to move."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",synopsis,,Rackam begins to remember the promise he made to Noa.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Rackam,The promise...
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Rackam,"I think I'm startin' to remember it... It was back then, when I met you, Noa."
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Rackam,We talked a lot. But what we talked about is still fuzzy.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Noa,I can see your eyes haven't changed a bit since then. So you'll remember it. I'm sure of it.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Noa,But I also want you to remember how happy I was when you made that promise to me.
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Rackam,If I could just remember...
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Imperial Soldier,Got 'em! How'd you lot get—
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Io,"Oh, for crying out loud! You guys just keep coming right as stuff starts to get good, don't you!"
English,"scene_cp27_q2_s20,2722",detail,Io,"[Djeeta], let's get 'em! These jerks've made me super mad!"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",synopsis,,Noa explains that it's the power of the primal beast Mithra that is keeping the Grandcypher grounded.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Rackam,Sigh... Promises...
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,Mind if I ask you a question?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,What is it? I hope I'll be able to answer it.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,"You said the Grandcypher won't be able to take off from this island, yeah?"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,But why is that exactly?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,"A promise was made, and the Grandcypher plays a crucial role in the fulfillment of that promise."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,"Yeah, but you can't take a promise made by a child seriously, can you?"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,And how would that prevent the Grandcypher from flyin' anyway?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Eugen,"I don't think you got it in you, but did you do somethin' with your primal beast powers?"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,"You are correct in suspecting that the power of a primal beast is at work. But, alas, it's not my own."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,Another primal beast resides on Golonzo.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Katalina,Another primal beast?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,"Yes. One native to this island. I'm more of a stray, so of course it would have more influence on this island than me."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,"Its name is Mithra, a primal beast who rules over promises. It's actually quite dangerous."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,"But on the other hand, you could say it's thanks to it that this island was even established."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Vyrn,So how bad could this thing be?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s10,2731",detail,Noa,Why don't we continue this conversation at the docks? It will be easier to explain over there.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",synopsis,,Noa tells the crew about the extent of Mithra's powers.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Ruffian,My very own airship! It's finally ready! Can't wait to get 'er in the air.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Ruffian,"Ah, here's the fee."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Shipwright,"Thank you, much obliged. Do come again!"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Vyrn,So why'd you bring us here?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Vyrn,Is that primal beast Mithra here or somethin'?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Lyria,"Uh-uh, I don't get that feeling."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,Look again. What do you notice?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Katalina,"Well, it doesn't seem that the people of this island put contracts in writing."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Katalina,"Even the maintenance fee for the Grandcypher didn't come with an invoice, and that was no small sum."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Eugen,That's just the way things've been done in Golonzo for decades. Don't think there's anything strange about it.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Eugen,"Everyone here has a strong sense of responsibility. No one would break a contract, written or unwritten."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"And that would be due to the power of Mithra, the primal beast of promises."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Rackam,What?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"It's just as you say, but in reverse. It isn't a sense of responsibility that keeps people from breaking contracts."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"Rather they've become responsible, because it's impossible to break a contract on this island."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"Mithra's powers work on an unconscious level to keep every contract, pact, or promise absolute and indestructible."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,This power of promises cannot be escaped by even the most powerful of primal beasts...
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Rackam,So that means Mithra is enforcing our promise?
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,That's right. Even though it was made by a silly little child.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"And now, for better or for worse, Mithra's powers are continuing to sustain it."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,This is why the Grandcypher can't take flight.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Vyrn,That's crazy... The Grandcypher's really bound by a primal beast's powers!
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Io,"Hey, hey! Can't Lyria do something about this with her powers? Like she did back in Albion?"
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Lyria,Yeah! If I can borrow some of its power and release the—
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,Unfortunately that's impossible. Mithra's power cannot be stopped even by Mithra itself.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,That is the true depth of its capability.
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Lyria,Wow...
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Monster,Groar!
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"But I should say there's nothing keeping me from telling you the details of our own promise, save my pride."
English,"scene_cp27_q3_s20,2732",detail,Noa,"I need you to remember them.<br>But first, allow me to help remove this distraction!"
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",synopsis,,Freesia appears and demands the crew turn over Lyria.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,"Well, well, well. This primal beast—Mithra, was it—seems to have quite a fearsome ability, doesn't it?"
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Vyrn,You again! When did—
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,"The power to enforce contracts... If used well, it will certainly increase the empire's dominion."
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,"Claiming it was to come second to recapturing Lyria, but you must reap when a harvest is ready, as they say."
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Katalina,"No, you mean... you've taken it?"
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,"You're aware of that doll, aren't you?"
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,So it shouldn't be hard for you to imagine how I did it.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Eugen,It takes someone real dirty to say such venomous stuff in such a matter-of-fact way.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Freesia,Now. Return Lyria at once.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s10,2741",detail,Imperial Soldier,...

English,"scene_cp27_q4_s20,2742",detail,Katalina,"Tch... If we stay here too long, it's possible they'll overwhelm us."
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s20,2742",detail,Katalina,We've got to make a break for it if we're to have any hope of fulfilling Noa's promise.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s20,2742",detail,Imperial Soldier,Don't think that you can escape. We've got this whole area sealed off. Not even a mouse could squeeze through us!
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s20,2742",detail,Io,Get out of the way already! We don't have time to dance with you goons!
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s20,2742",detail,Katalina,"They outnumber us... But we're going to break through. Prepare yourself, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",synopsis,,"After breaking past the imperial forces, Freesia appears, captures Lyria, and subtly announces that Mithra is under imperial control."

English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Rackam,Huff... Did we give them the slip?
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Katalina,They had the numbers advantage... Huff-huff... But we managed to—
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Freesia,No... My men performed most admirably.
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Freesia,"Thanks to them, we were able to recover Lyria."
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Rackam,What!
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Lyria,Katalina! [Djeeta]!

English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Katalina,No... No! Get out my way! Move!
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Eugen,There's too many! Get too close and you're a goner!
English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Rackam,This woman again! Leave us alone!

English,"scene_cp27_q4_s30,2743",detail,Freesia,"Back to the empire where she belongs. Yes, <span class='scene-font-italic'>he</span> will be most pleased with both the girl and Mithra."
