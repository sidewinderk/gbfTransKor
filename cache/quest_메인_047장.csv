English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,,The shrine stands silent before them with an overpowering presence.
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Lyria,I feel power emanating from the shrine. Something different from the power of the stars. Something out of harmony...
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Lecia,I think it's safe to assume that this is the place where Vyrn's true abilities are sealed away.
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Drang,"Come on then, you lovely lizard! Open this thing up and let's get started!"
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,...
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Rackam,"What's wrong, Vyrn? Still worried about something?"
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Rackam,"Ah, of course. This shrine isn't meant to be opened, is it?"
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,That's right. I'm scared.
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,Rosetta said I probably wouldn't want to remember...
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,"If I break the seal, maybe those memories I don't want will also come back."
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,I have no memories from before [Djeeta]'s dad found me.
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,"But being with [Djeeta] was such fun, and we got to travel all over too."

English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Vyrn,"I don't want those memories. If at all possible, I'd rather just keep the seal in place."
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Katalina,Vyrn...
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Drang,"Oh, dear! There's no helping some lizards, is there!"
English,"scene_cp47_q3_s20,4731",detail,Sturm,So it's come to this?

English,"scene_cp47_q4_s20,4741",detail,Vyrn,In order to save the Black Knight?
English,"scene_cp47_q4_s20,4741",detail,Drang,"I think we were pretty upfront about that part, right?"
English,"scene_cp47_q4_s20,4741",detail,Drang,So we can't have you backing out of this now.
English,"scene_cp47_q4_s20,4741",detail,Drang,"I know you have a lot to consider, and that you're worried about plenty of things."
English,"scene_cp47_q4_s20,4741",detail,Drang,But we're making the most of a bad situation here—that's all. So hurry up and break the seal.
