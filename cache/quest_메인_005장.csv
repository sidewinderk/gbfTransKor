English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,You sure chose a dangerous place to rendezvous!
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,Our top priority is secrecy.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,Guess that means you're not about to share your real name. Anyway. Let's hear what you have to say.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,I'm most grateful for your understanding.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,"I would like your assistance in locating none other than Tzaka the Great, the Archduke of Valtz."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Katalina,We've heard rumors that he's been kidnapped by the Erste Empire.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,We don't have any specific proof. Whoever did it was smart enough not to leave behind any clues.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,And I'm not able to comment on our relationship with the empire. Please accept my apologies.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,"If you accept my request, I have some... documents you may be interested in."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,A record of the archduke's steps just before he disappeared. Talk about detailed...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,"Hey, don't you realize what you just did? You agreed to help the minute you looked at those papers!"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,Well...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,This sounds like nothing but a heap of trouble. But we'll do what we have to.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Katalina,I can't help but be concerned knowing that the empire may be involved.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,"All right, [Djeeta]! Let's check all the locations mentioned in these papers!"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",synopsis,,"As they search for the archduke, [Djeeta] and company realize that the shadow following them has disappeared. They then encounter a mysterious girl who is under attack by monsters."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Lyria,"Searching for the archduke is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, [Djeeta]..."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Vyrn,All we've heard is rumor after fishy rumor. Nothin' close to the kind of evidence we need...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,There's even talk about the archduke and empire teaming up to create a doomsday device. The rumor mill just never stops.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Katalina,Whatever was trailing us yesterday seems to have disappeared too.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,You're right. I haven't sensed it at all today.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,Hm?
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,???,Hey! What're you doing? Let me <span class='scene-font-italic'>go</span>!
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Vyrn,"That girl's in danger! You don't think she's the one who's been following us, do you?"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Katalina,"From how she's dressed, I'm guessing she's a mage. What could this all be about?"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,"The kid's being attacked! We have to do something, [Djeeta]! C'mon!"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",synopsis,,[Djeeta] and company ask Siero to gather info on the mysterious girl who is following them. They then continue searching for the archduke.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,"How's the job going, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,It looks like you're working hard... or should I say hardly working?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,Heh heh. I really have to write that one down...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Lemme put it this way: we've got zero clues, some weird girl is trailing us, and I can't figure out how to walk on the sand..."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Vyrn,"Now that you mention it, where'd that mage girl from earlier go anyway?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,She must have run off. Can't imagine how she managed on this sand...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,She had beautiful hair. I wish we could have talked to her...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Lyria,"Me too! She looks a little younger than me, but I wonder if we could be friends."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,Don't you worry. I'm sure you two would get along just fine.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,Hm... So she's a mage...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,We don't need her getting in the way of our job.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Is there anything you can do, Siero?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,I'll do what I can.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Thanks. We're counting on you, Siero."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,All right [Djeeta]. Let's just keep tracing the archduke's footsteps!
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",synopsis,,"As they trek across the endless sea of sand, Katalina notices something missing and remembers the mysterious girl."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,That mage doesn't seem to be following us today.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Lyria,I wanna talk to her...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Don't worry. I'm sure you'll get the opportunity before long.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Lyria,"If I make friends with lots of other girls, will I be more normal?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Vyrn,What's wrong with Katalina? You sayin' she's too old?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Hey! I'm still in the prime of my youth!
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Lyria,"You're more important to me than a friend, Katalina. You're more like a big sister!"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Wh-where did this come from?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Monster,Groaar!
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Enough idle chatter! We have monsters to contend with!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",synopsis,,Siero informs [Djeeta] and company that the mysterious mage girl they saw earlier is being held ransom. The crew rushes to her rescue.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Sierokarte,"I have some important news about that girl you mentioned this morning, [Djeeta]."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,Oh? And what might that be?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,"<span class='scene-font-italic'>We have the mage. If you ever want to see her again, come to the specified location tomorrow at high noon.</span>"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Vyrn,That isn't news! That's a ransom letter!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Katalina,"What's the meaning of this, Siero?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Vyrn,"Who brought you that letter, shopkeep?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Sierokarte,To tell you the truth... it wasn't a letter so much as a note posted to my message board.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Katalina,Then tracing it back is probably out of the question...
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Sierokarte,"But why that girl of all people? Could they have mistaken her for a member of your crew, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,"What do you want to do, [Djeeta]? Ignoring it isn't totally out of the question..."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Vyrn,"I can tell from the look on your face that you're not gonna let this one go, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Katalina,They're clearly trying to threaten us. But this may just be the clue we need to find the archduke.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,That's that then. We've got a mage to save. The rest will take care of itself!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",synopsis,,"The kidnapper at the specified location turns out to be none other than Drang, who the crew previously encountered at Port Breeze. Before [Djeeta] and company can say anything to him, a monster attacks."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Rackam,"We came just like you said, kidnappers! Now show yourselves!"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,Mmm... I just knew you would accept our invitation.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,You're one of those goofballs we ran into back at Port Breeze! What're you doin' here?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Ah yes, you certainly saved our bacon back there! But that nice thank-you letter we sent you should put us on even footing, don't you agree?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,Looks like he's back to working for the empire.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,"Let's get him, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,Easy there! Have you forgotten that I'm the one with the hostage?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,You haven't? Well then! Allow me to reassure you that she's safe and sound in Sturm's company!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Dreadfully sorry about all this. We're in something of a bind ourselves. You... wouldn't happen to know where the archduke is, would you?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,How dare you...
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Rackam,Don't give me that! You're with the empire! You know more about what's going on than any of us!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Now, now. No need to play dumb! We know you met with one of the archduke's inner circle. Where's he hiding?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,What was that?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,This is getting us nowhere...
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,Hm?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Machina Soldier,...!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,What the!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,Some sort of ambush?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Save me, Sturm! Oh my goodness... What in the world is this strange machine?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Lyria,"It's not alive, but I can faintly sense the power of primal crystals... Who could be controlling it?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,"Whatever it is, we'll give it the fight it's looking for! Let's kick some butt, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",synopsis,,"After defeating the mechanical creature, [Djeeta] and company find their shadowy follower lying unconscious and decide to protect her."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Vyrn,I've never seen anything like that before. Was it a machine? Or a monster?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Lyria,It seemed so strange!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Lyria,But something about it was... well...
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Katalina,Hey! That girl from earlier is over here!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Rackam,She's passed out... but seems to be okay otherwise.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Lyria,"I don't think she's safe here, [Djeeta]. We should take her back."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Katalina,"Of course. Lend me a hand, Rackam."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Rackam,Sure thing!
