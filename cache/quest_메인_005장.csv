English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Rackam,"Yeah, I noticed. Someone's following us."
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",sel1_txt,,Someone from the empire?
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",sel2_txt,,Who could it be?
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Rackam,This isn't like them though. The empire would normally just attack... no questions asked.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Vyrn,That's definitely been our experience with 'em so far.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Rackam,Someone's watching us. Not feeling any hostility though.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Vyrn,You never know who you might be dealing with! Maybe they're keepin' their hostility under wraps!
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Katalina,They appear to be using magic to stay hidden from sight.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Monster,Groaaar!
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Vyrn,This town's been nothin' but trouble so far. Let's just deal with the bad guys we can <span class='scene-font-italic'>see</span> for now.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Katalina,Agreed.
English,"scene_cp5_q1_s20,512",detail,Katalina,Let's shake these guys off and push ahead!

English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,Yup!
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,You sure chose a dangerous place to rendezvous!
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,Our top priority is secrecy.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,Guess that means you're not about to share your real name. Anyway. Let's hear what you have to say.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,I'm most grateful for your understanding.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,"I would like your assistance in locating none other than Tzaka the Great, the Archduke of Valtz."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Katalina,We've heard rumors that he's been kidnapped by the Erste Empire.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,We don't have any specific proof. Whoever did it was smart enough not to leave behind any clues.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,And I'm not able to comment on our relationship with the empire. Please accept my apologies.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Christophe,"If you accept my request, I have some... documents you may be interested in."
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,A record of the archduke's steps just before he disappeared. Talk about detailed...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Vyrn,"Hey, don't you realize what you just did? You agreed to help the minute you looked at those papers!"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,Well...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s10,521",detail,Rackam,This sounds like nothing but a heap of trouble. But we'll do what we have to.

English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Vyrn,All we've heard is rumor after fishy rumor. Nothin' close to the kind of evidence we need...
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,There's even talk about the archduke and empire teaming up to create a doomsday device. The rumor mill just never stops.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Katalina,Whatever was trailing us yesterday seems to have disappeared too.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,You're right. I haven't sensed it at all today.
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Rackam,Hm?
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,???,Hey! What're you doing? Let me <span class='scene-font-italic'>go</span>!
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Vyrn,"That girl's in danger! You don't think she's the one who's been following us, do you?"
English,"scene_cp5_q2_s20,522",detail,Katalina,"From how she's dressed, I'm guessing she's a mage. What could this all be about?"

English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,It looks like you're working hard... or should I say hardly working?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,Heh heh. I really have to write that one down...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Lemme put it this way: we've got zero clues, some weird girl is trailing us, and I can't figure out how to walk on the sand..."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Vyrn,"Now that you mention it, where'd that mage girl from earlier go anyway?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,She must have run off. Can't imagine how she managed on this sand...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,She had beautiful hair. I wish we could have talked to her...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Lyria,"Me too! She looks a little younger than me, but I wonder if we could be friends."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,Don't you worry. I'm sure you two would get along just fine.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,Hm... So she's a mage...
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,We don't need her getting in the way of our job.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Is there anything you can do, Siero?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Sierokarte,I'll do what I can.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Rackam,"Thanks. We're counting on you, Siero."
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s10,531",detail,Katalina,All right [Djeeta]. Let's just keep tracing the archduke's footsteps!

English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Don't worry. I'm sure you'll get the opportunity before long.
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Lyria,"If I make friends with lots of other girls, will I be more normal?"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Vyrn,What's wrong with Katalina? You sayin' she's too old?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Hey! I'm still in the prime of my youth!
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Lyria,"You're more important to me than a friend, Katalina. You're more like a big sister!"
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Katalina,Wh-where did this come from?
English,"scene_cp5_q3_s20,532",detail,Monster,Groaar!

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Vyrn,"Who brought you that letter, shopkeep?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Sierokarte,To tell you the truth... it wasn't a letter so much as a note posted to my message board.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Katalina,Then tracing it back is probably out of the question...
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Sierokarte,"But why that girl of all people? Could they have mistaken her for a member of your crew, [Djeeta]?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,"What do you want to do, [Djeeta]? Ignoring it isn't totally out of the question..."
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Vyrn,"I can tell from the look on your face that you're not gonna let this one go, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Katalina,They're clearly trying to threaten us. But this may just be the clue we need to find the archduke.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s10,541",detail,Rackam,That's that then. We've got a mage to save. The rest will take care of itself!
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",synopsis,,"The kidnapper at the specified location turns out to be none other than Drang, who the crew previously encountered at Port Breeze. Before [Djeeta] and company can say anything to him, a monster attacks."

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,Mmm... I just knew you would accept our invitation.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,You're one of those goofballs we ran into back at Port Breeze! What're you doin' here?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Ah yes, you certainly saved our bacon back there! But that nice thank-you letter we sent you should put us on even footing, don't you agree?"
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Vyrn,Looks like he's back to working for the empire.

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Drang,"Dreadfully sorry about all this. We're in something of a bind ourselves. You... wouldn't happen to know where the archduke is, would you?"

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Rackam,Don't give me that! You're with the empire! You know more about what's going on than any of us!

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,What was that?
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s20,542",detail,Katalina,This is getting us nowhere...

English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Rackam,She's passed out... but seems to be okay otherwise.
English,"scene_cp5_q4_s30,543",detail,Lyria,"I don't think she's safe here, [Djeeta]. We should take her back."
