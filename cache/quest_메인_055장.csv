English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Vyrn,Why do you need to beg us to do stuff?
English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Adam,I am powerless against the Astrals and the dark essence that mimics their power.
English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Adam,It's not a question of being strong or weak. That's just the way it is.
English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Vyrn,"Hmm... That's how it is, huh?"
English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Adam,"Yes. In any case, more monsters are closing in."
English,"scene_cp55_q1_s20,5512",detail,Adam,"[Djeeta], draw your weapon. We will intercept them."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",synopsis,,"General Adam shows the crew a secret facility and tells the history of the primal beast Deus Ex Machina. This primal beast, under the control of the empire, is the source of everyone's troubles."

English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,,He takes them to a hidden facility.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Io,What is this place? It's full of sleeping people...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,No. These people are not sleeping.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,They can do nothing but lie there as if they were dolls.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,Dolls...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"I believe you know of the primal beast Akasha, correct?"
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Lyria,Yes. It was the one with a terrible power in Lumacie.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Then do you know of the other primal beast under the empire's control?
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,What are you talking about?
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Drang,Hmm... That's news to my ears as well...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Its name is Deus Ex Machina.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Unlike Akasha, this primal beast was not simply passed on for safekeeping."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Before the War, it was given to Erste as an official gift from the Astrals."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Rosetta,"The Astrals gave a primal beast to Erste, a country of the Sky Realm?"
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Erste's golem technology was the strongest force in the Sky Realm at the time. Yielding it to the Astrals was a long shot attempt at protecting their citizens.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"As for the Astrals, there was only one reason to give Erste their very own primal beast."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Eugen,Hmm? So Erste's been cozy with the Astrals since before the War started?
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Eugen,"When the Astrals lost the War, Erste didn't just take them in..."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,Erste came off as traitors for harboring the invaders of the world.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,That is right. Therefore the primal beast was buried deep in Erste's dark history.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,But it was Deus Ex Machina that started all of this tragedy.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,Tragedy... You don't mean—
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Deus Ex Machina is to blame for Princess Orchis losing her heart.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,...!
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"In those days, Erste was obsessed with creating the perfect golem."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Yet no matter how many experiments they performed, they never managed to create a golem with a heart."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Of the numerous mortal vessels they tried to make, all they could create were empty dolls."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"While they wrestled with this problem, the Astrals appeared from beyond the skies."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,,"In the past, Erste had a monopoly on golem production, the greatest military potential in the skies."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,,But even that wouldn't be enough to stave the Astral onslaught. Erste knew this and immediately surrendered.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,,"In doing so, the strongest nation in the Sky Realm avoided a full-scale attack from the Astrals by falling under their control."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Once Erste cooperated with the Astrals, they asked for a primal beast."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"In order to create the perfect golem they so desired, they needed something with the ability to manipulate souls."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Lyria,Primal beast Deus Ex Machina...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Io,Manipulate souls? So it could make a real live heart?
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,No. Even the Astrals were unable to create such a primal beast.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Deus Ex Machina does not have the power to create or destroy.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"It can substitute people's souls, extract them, or lock them away into empty vessels."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Its only power is to transpose souls.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Vyrn,"Huh? Then I don't get how that'd help make golems, you know what I'm sayin'?"
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Vyrn,Because you'd still need a heart from somewhere to put into the golem.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Rosetta,"In order to make the <span class='scene-font-italic'>perfect</span> golem, they needed to sacrifice someone. Is that what you're saying?"
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Correct. That is the reason the Erste researchers decided not to use the primal beast after all.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"Time passed. Then around ten years ago, Deus Ex Machina once again saw the light of day."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Black Knight,Ten years ago...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Prime Minister Freesia used dark essence to lift the seal on the primal beast.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,Although back then dark essence was even more unstable than it is now.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,As a result the primal beast raged uncontrollably and claimed the lives of the king and queen.
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,"And the only surviving member of the royal family, Princess Orchis, had her soul drawn out."
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Lyria,So that's why Orchis is...
English,"scene_cp55_q2_s10,5521",detail,Adam,That is the true story behind this tragedy—the root of all this sorrow.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",synopsis,,General Adam reveals that Orchis and all of the doll-like people lying in the facility have had their souls taken away by the primal beast Deus Ex Machina. Freesia is planning to harvest all the souls in the capital using this method.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Black Knight,I can't believe it... That's how Orchis came to be a living doll?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Black Knight,T-tell me... Is it possible to bring Orchis back?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Deus Ex Machina does not have the ability to destroy souls.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"Thus Princess Orchis's soul should still be in Mephorash, though we have no way of interacting with it."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Black Knight,But her soul remains... If we could just get our hands on that primal beast—
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"With Deus Ex Machina, I believe Princess Orchis could return to her former state."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Black Knight,The real Orchis...
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Lyria,...
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Eugen,"Hold on, big shot. Why're you tellin' this to us now?"
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Eugen,And who're all these people lyin' down around us?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Eugen,"From what you've told us, they look like they're all in the same boat as Orchis..."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,They are the reason I brought you here.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Rosetta,Hmm? Are we finally getting to the real issue at hand?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Deus Ex Machina is currently being used in Freesia's plan.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Io,Her plan?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Yes. She is going to have Deus Ex Machina draw out these people's souls.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Then she will convert them into pseudo-Astral energy using dark essence.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Everyone here is a test subject.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"Thus with the souls converted to pseudo-Astral energy, her large-scale device will also be completed."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Lyria,Wh-why would Freesia do something like that?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Rosetta,I see... It's time for it to be awakened...
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Yes. Freesia's true goal is to activate Akasha.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,That's why she acquired control over Deus Ex Machina and the dark essence-infused device.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Io,Wait a minute... Doesn't she still need Lyria and Orchis to use Akasha?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Io,Why else was she targeting both of them then?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"For the activation to succeed, Lyria is needed as the vessel and Orchis as the key."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,But Freesia intends to use the immense power of the pseudo-Astral energy to force Akasha's activation.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Eugen,And she needs to harvest all these souls to get that much power?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Eugen,Just how many people will she need to do that?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Millions. Freesia is going to sacrifice all of the people living in the imperial capital.
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Io,E-everyone... in the capital?
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"If Akasha were to change history, it wouldn't stop with the loss of the capital."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,"I think you understand this, but the world as we know it will be lost."
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Vyrn,No way... After all we went through to get Lyria and Orchis back...
English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Adam,Everything I have told you is what convinced me to reach out to you.

English,"scene_cp55_q3_s20,5531",detail,Rosetta,"There aren't too many of them, but I doubt we can slip on by. Prepare yourself, [Djeeta]!"
