English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,"So these grunts are no match for me, and he knows it."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Katalina,Good point... But you've got one thing wrong.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,Huh? Really? What exactly?
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Katalina,"You <span class='scene-font-italic'>are</span> a genius. Perhaps not when it comes to combat, but you have something special that others clearly don't."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Katalina,"You're too hard on yourself. Keep it up for too long, and it will become an unfortunate habit."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,Th-thank you for saying that.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lyria,"Ah! Lecia, you're blushing!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,"What! Ah, I'm sorry! I'm not really used to hearing this kind of thing!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,"I've always thought you were really harsh, Katalina, so it's kind of surprising hearing you praise me like this."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Katalina,Really? I don't mean to give that impression...
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Io,"I'm with Lecia on this. You can be kinda scary when you're around her, Katalina."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lyria,Haha. But Katalina has a cute side too! Like when she gets flustered around Vyrn!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Lecia,She's got a side like that?
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Katalina,Lyria! There's no need to bring that up now!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s10,4431",detail,Eugen,"Sorry to interrupt this touching scene, but we've still got imperial goons incomin'! Get ready, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",synopsis,,"Gandharva falls for Lecia's bait. At her signal, hidden Enforcers appear to assist [Djeeta] and the crew launch a full scale attack against the lieutenant general."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,Everybody hold on a second. This is the place.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,Our flying column should be in position by now.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,So now we just need Gandharva to come face us here.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,Oh! All this for me?
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Io,Looks like he's all alone. Seems like he doesn't have any soldiers with him at all...
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,Coming to the front line without any backup? What is he plotting?
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,I could ask you the same thing about your own little plan! Let's just stop with all the tricks!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,What happened to your Enforcers? The only ones I see around you are those wanted criminals.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,"Wiped out... Pfft, doubt that. So where are they, huh?"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,There's no need for us to answer that.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,"Oh, is that so? Well, if you're planning on acting as a decoy, then you've lost, Lecia!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,All the men in my personal guard are defending the Fourth Hall even as we speak!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,"Even if I'm not there with them, your people won't be able to take the Fourth Hall back!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,I see. That's totally fine.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,What?
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,You're right that we split our forces into two.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,But you got the destination wrong. They aren't anywhere near the Fourth Hall.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"They're right here, with us!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,,"When Lecia raises her arm, dozens of skyfarers appear from hiding places. They have Gandharva completely surrounded."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,Well...
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"Dividing our forces naturally made you think that we were fighting on two fronts, and using one group as a decoy."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"However, even if we take the base back, it would mean nothing if you're still alive."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,So our first order of business has to be to defeat you using everything we've got.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"In order to achieve that, we needed to reduce the numbers of those defending you as much as possible."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,So we made you think that we were the decoy and made you divide your own forces as a result.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,Impressive! So cunning and so proud—just like your damn father.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,There's just one thing you've overlooked.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,Defeat me with everything you've got? That's a novel idea.
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,"But if this rag-tag band is all you've got, you sure you can beat me?"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"Well. I guess we'll find out, won't we?"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Gandharva,"That's what I like to hear! Come on, all of you! No holding back! I'll punch you all into oblivion!"
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Katalina,"Hah. Fair enough. He's asking for it, so let's give him what he wants."
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Rackam,You said it! I've had enough of this ape!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Io,Let's do this! I wanna see how he likes the taste of my magic!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Eugen,Pride comes before a fall. We'll teach him the price of overconfidence!
English,"scene_cp44_q3_s20,4432",detail,Lecia,"It's time, [Djeeta]. Let's focus all of our strength and defeat Lieutenant General Gandharva once and for all!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",synopsis,,"Although [Djeeta] and the others focus everything they've got on Gandharva, he's able to pick them off one by one. Lecia curses her inability to do anything, but she still fights on in order to save her comrades."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Rackam,Whew... Talk about focused fire! I reckon we could even defeat a primal beast fightin' like this!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Io,"Yeah, but isn't this kind of a lot?"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Sigh...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,...!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Katalina,I-impossible! How did he survive all of that?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Mm? That it? My turn now.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Katalina,What! He vanished!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lyria,Katalina! Behind you!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Katalina,Wha—
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Katalina,G'ugh!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,One down.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Rackam,Damn it! How did he do that? Is this what he's really capable of?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Indeed it is.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Rackam,Ahh! When did—
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Rackam,Argh!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,"Insurmountable odds are boring. Felt better when I was holding back, didn't it?"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,No one even tries to fight an opponent when they know they absolutely cannot win.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,No...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,,"Faced with Gandharva's immense strength, the crew and Lecia's enforcers helplessly fall one by one."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,,"Soon [Djeeta], Vyrn, Lyria, and Lecia are the only ones left standing."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Now then. Looks like you four are the only ones left. I have to admit this has been fun.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,Grr...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,"Looks like you guys did your best. You're on the way to achieving true strength, most definitely."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,"But right now, you simply aren't good enough. You don't have what it takes to stand up to me."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,(Father... Is this really how it ends?)
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,(I was afraid of this... That I wouldn't be able to save everyone...)
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,(That I don't have what it takes...)
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,No.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Come again?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,To save someone... To protect your friends... You don't need anything special.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,I'm not a hero like my father. And I don't have the kind of power that he or Monika have.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,But I'm still the one who promised to save my friends!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,I vowed to protect them! And I won't let anyone take that away from me!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,Which means? You're not a hero. You've got no power to speak of. What exactly do you plan to do?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,"I won't allow you to hurt anyone else! I'm going to defeat you, here and now!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,"Hahaha! Come on then, try it!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Gandharva,The daughter of a tyrant who commands the skies... Show me the power of your bloodline!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s10,4441",detail,Lecia,"We can do this, [Djeeta]. I'm not going to run away again. I will not lose!"

English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,Pant... Pant...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Vyrn,"H-hey! Lecia, are you okay?"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Gandharva,"So that was your full power. Not bad. You're the child of that tyrant, no doubt."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Gandharva,"I must look like a fool... But, argh, this is it..."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Imperial Soldier,"Lieutenant General! Someone, help him!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Imperial Soldier,Retreat! We need to get off this island immediately and get the lieutenant general to safety!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,,"Although the battle was furious, [Djeeta] and Lecia prove victorious against Gandharva."

English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,"Th-thank you... But please, I'm bruised all over, so stop patting my back so hard!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Bah, you fought Gandharva, so you're lucky to just be bruised a little!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,I guess so... Ouch...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"That was more than luck, wasn't it? I need to thank you too, [Djeeta]."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Although, after everything you've done for Lecia, I don't think I can thank you enough!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Rackam,"Seriously, you guys finished him off before we had come to."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Katalina,Haha. You really are something else.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Io,I can't believe that guy could just hurt people so easily!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Eugen,"Haha. Well, from what I've heard, sounds like he's a lot worse for wear than any of us."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,Indeed. But we have to use this time to fortify our defenses as best we can.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,We can't be sure that they won't be back to mount another offensive.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Ah, but Lecia, there's something else we need to discuss."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,And I think you know where this is going...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,Yeah... I'm sorry for leaving the island without permission.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,There are serious repercussions when a captain acts so irresponsibly.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"And what's worse, you unfortunately weren't around when they invaded."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"As your second in command, it's my job to pass judgment on you."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,I understand.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lyria,Wait a moment! Lecia saved the island. Please don't be too harsh on her.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,Saving the island is one thing. This is another thing entirely.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"You see, doing a good thing doesn't automatically erase a bad one."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,"Thank you, Lyria, but it's okay. I knew this was coming."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"In which case... Lecia, as the deputy captain of the Fourth Fleet..."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,I hereby recommend that you resign your post as captain of the Fourth Fleet.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,Okay...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,Will you? That's only my recommendation. I won't force the issue.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,"No, you're right. I think it was a little too soon for me to become a captain."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lyria,Lecia...
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Therefore, by the power invested in me as the deputy captain, I accept your resignation."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,Which makes me the tentative captain of the Fourth.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,"It does... But that's, um, obvious?"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Ahem. Then, Lecia, let me immediately give you some new orders."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,Huh?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,Lecia. I order you to become part of [Djeeta]'s crew. Effective immediately.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,Wha... What!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,It sounds like you and [Djeeta] have become quite an effective team.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,"Maybe, but this is still a bit out of the blue..."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Katalina,"I think it's a good idea. We've no reason to turn her down, right?"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",sel1_txt,,Welcome aboard!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",sel2_txt,,I'll show you what real work is!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Vyrn,Well said! The more the merrier!
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,What? You're not going to make me swab any decks are you?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"Anyway, on a serious note, the Erste Empire has been acting most suspiciously recently."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,I want the Crew of Enforcers to join forces with [Djeeta] and work together to oppose the empire.
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Lecia,And that's why you're assigning me to [Djeeta]'s crew?
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,Monika,"You're right on the money! Profit from this new experience, Lecia!"
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,,"To seal Lecia's new orders, Monika slaps [Djeeta]'s newest crew member on the back."
English,"scene_cp44_q4_s30,4442",detail,,"Lecia reels from the smack, but her heart flutters at the thought of the coming adventures."
