English,"scene_cp22_q1_s10,2211",detail,???,...!<br>What's it to you?
English,"scene_cp22_q1_s10,2211",detail,Lyria,"Nothing, I guess. I was just curious... about why you look so sad."

English,"scene_cp22_q1_s10,2211",detail,???,Of course... I won't make it easy for you!

English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,Io,How about you just tell us how to get off this island!

English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,???,No one can do anything about her now. About my little sister...
English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,Rosetta,"Ah, so you have a sister? She must be as cute as you are!"
English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,???,Yes... A little sister anyone could be proud of. But she'd be older than me now... if she's still alive.
English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,Katalina,If she's still alive? That's a curious thing to say. What do you mean?
English,"scene_cp22_q1_s20,2212",detail,???,Humph! How about worrying about yourselves first before getting carried away?

English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Drang,"Hm... I've got an idea! If we stop for a minute and take a look around, we might just see her!"

English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Sturm,We're looking so shut your trap already!
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Sturm,That kid—ghost or whatever she is—needs to learn a lesson...

English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Drang,See that cliff there? I heard that place is pretty special to her and—ow!
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Sturm,Here we go again! Why didn't you say something earlier?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Drang,"Ow! Wait! Wait a minute, Sturm! Why are you stabbing me this time?"
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s10,2221",detail,Drang,I thought you'd pat me on the back for being so help—ow!

English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Drang,"Heh-heh! I have my sources, you see!"
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,Have we... met somewhere?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Lyria,Please tell us! Did you summon Celeste for your little sister?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,My sister was suffering from an incurable disease. But the only way to get treatment was to leave the island...
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,At that time airship technology was laughably primitive. It was a gamble as to whether or not you'd survive the trip.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,But it was my sister's only hope. So she left the island... and I haven't heard from her since.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Katalina,So you called Celeste to bring your sister back to life?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,Ha! Of course not! I'm sure she's still alive. She'd never die that easily.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,"She might've been weak, but she was more stubborn than I am. She could endure anything."
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Io,So how'd it end up here? How did you summon a primal beast?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,It was just a stupid thing really... Just a silly wish...
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,I just... I just wanted to hear my family call my name again. Is that such a bad thing?
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,I didn't think that wanting to hear that one word would cause all this...
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Rosetta,"Family, you say? So... right now your family is where?"
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,They're gone. All of them died in a plague... leaving me all alone.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,"So when I too became ill, I made a wish. A wish that I could hear my family call my name once again..."
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,That's when Celeste appeared.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Vyrn,"But according to the villagers, Celeste's powers don't work like that..."
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,"They're right. Celeste has the power to steal death, but not to bring things back to life."
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,So in the end I couldn't get my family back. And I've had to face my loneliness ever since.
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,Lyria,That's... That's just awful...
English,"scene_cp22_q2_s20,2222",detail,???,"It's the end of the story too! I've got my most prized monster here, so I hope you're ready!"

English,"scene_cp22_q3_s10,2231",detail,Lyria,No! We can't do that! Not after all you've told us!
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s10,2231",detail,Lyria,About your little sister... About your family... We can't just leave you like this!
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s10,2231",detail,Drang,We came this far after all! Leaving now would feel kind of pointless.

English,"scene_cp22_q3_s20,2232",detail,Rosetta,Seems we don't really need to look far! Just over there...
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s20,2232",detail,Io,You can see the monsters are protecting something.
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s20,2232",detail,Rosetta,Exactly. It's clear that she and the monsters get along pretty well.
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s20,2232",detail,Lyria,I feel bad... Those monsters have just been trying to protect their friend the whole time.
English,"scene_cp22_q3_s20,2232",detail,Lyria,But I think there's been a big misunderstanding with that girl! We need to talk to her!

English,"scene_cp22_q4_s10,2241",detail,Sturm,"But maybe... Just maybe next time when you decide to do something dangerous, you'll tell me first."
