English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Monika,Gasp...
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,???,"Well, well, well. You've certainly seen better days, Captain of the Fourth Fleet, Monika."
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Monika,"Sorry to break it to you, Gandharva, but I'm only the deputy captain now."
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,Humph. Of course I know that.
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,But look at you now. The once great Monika is now a lowly prisoner.
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Monika,"Hah! Big of you to say, considering you're the one who threw me in here."
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,That's why I said it. The old you would have at least given me a run for my money.
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Monika,I don't know about that. I don't have a lust for battle like you do.
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,"You've grown soft. I don't know if you're trying to teach your successor a lesson or what, but you abandoned your post as captain too quickly."
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,No bite left in you at all. Guess that's one less opponent who's capable of helping me pass the time.

English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,"Don't play dumb. You know already, don't you?"
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Monika,Then my hunch was right. But don't think for a second that your plan will go smoothly.
English,"scene_cp42_q1_s10,4211",detail,Gandharva,That's why I threw you in this cell. And it looks like that was the right decision! Your little friend is beside herself.

English,"scene_cp42_q2_s10,4221",detail,Imperial Soldier,A-ah! Looks like we missed some of the skyfarers! Where did you hide Captain Lecia?
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s10,4221",detail,Rackam,"Tch... Katalina, looks like your feeling was right on the money."
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s10,4221",detail,Katalina,Why is an imperial soldier here? What happened to the Crew of Enforcers?

English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Imperial Soldier 2,We're at a disadvantage in these streets. But it's probably a walk in the park for them...
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Imperial Soldier 1,Grr... Guess we should report to the lieutenant general that we encountered some skyfarers.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Io,Yep... They're gone.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Rackam,Whew... I wonder what's happened here.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Rackam,Why are there imperials strutting around the island like they own the place? Isn't this Enforcer territory?
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Katalina,No idea. But one thing's for certain...
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Eugen,We'll have to look into Vyrn's past some other time.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Vyrn,Shucks... Why's this kinda thing always gotta happen to us?
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Katalina,First we should look for Monika or Lecia. I'm sure one of them will be able to explain the situation.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Rackam,"Well, let's just hope they got time to stop and chat about it..."
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Lyria,"You know... I see plenty of soldiers, but I don't see any skyfarers..."
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Lyria,Something might have happened to the Crew of Enforcers.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Io,All we can do now is find someone who looks like they know what's going on!
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Rackam,"Better yet, wouldn't it be faster to just grab one of these soldiers and beat it out of them?"
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Katalina,They're military professionals. I don't think they'll give up their secrets that easily.
English,"scene_cp42_q2_s20,4222",detail,Katalina,The town isn't crawling with just soldiers; there's plenty of monsters too. Be on your guard while we look for Monika or Lecia.

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s10,4241",detail,Lecia,Come with me. I'll take you to a place where we can calm down and speak.

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",synopsis,,"The crew head further into the outskirts of the city, where there are fewer soldiers but more monsters."

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Lecia,"True, but don't let your guard down. The empire's placed soldiers in every little nook and cranny of this island."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Katalina,What? You make it sound as if the empire is occupying Amalthea...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Lecia,...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Rackam,Yep... I think I'm starting to see the bigger picture here. This island's definitely in a crisis.

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Understood. It's hard to get your hopes up in a situation like this.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Please report back to recon and tell them to check the emergency bunkers throughout the island.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"Among them, old abandoned-looking ones take the most precedence."

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Yes. Monika helmed the Fourth Fleet's retaliation.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,However—
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,"They lost, right? Otherwise this wouldn't be happening right now?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,No way! We fought her when we were fleeing Amalthea!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,"She was small, but ridiculously strong!"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,Yes... I must admit it's hard to believe that Monika could lose so easily.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,I had my doubts too. I was sure that there was some kind of mistake.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,But it's all fact. And now Monika is imprisoned in the Fourth Hall jail.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,Insanity... How did this happen?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,I can explain that part...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,The elderly skyfarer steps forward to address the crew.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,"When the empire invaded, Captain Lecia was absent, but Deputy Captain Monika was here on the island."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,"So we weren't worried. We were all certain that no matter what happened, we couldn't lose."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,But the imperial commander... I'm not certain if I should say...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Eugen,"Hey now... At this point, let's not hide anything else, all right?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Please continue. We can trust these people.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,Very well... The imperial commander is Lieutenant General Gandharva.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,He was once a captain for the Crew of Enforcers.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,What? Then why would he...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"By the time I joined the Crew of Enforcers, Gandharva had already been kicked out of the crew."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"So I read the files we had on him, and apparently he had overwhelming skill—rivaling even Monika's power."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"But he was exceedingly violent and arrogant, and he refused to accept any consequences for his actions."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"He was at the top of the crew. But after he fought and lost to the Blue Knight in a duel, he was exiled from our crew, never to be seen on this island again."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,"This guy thought he'd pay a little visit to his former home now that he's the empire's lieutenant general, eh?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,S-such a powerful guy's out there right now?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"After defeating Monika, he took over the Fourth Hall as the lieutenant general of the imperial army."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"So to summarize, he's hijacked your headquarters, and the remaining forces are still resisting."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Vyrn,Whoa now... This is startin' to sound more serious than I coulda imagined!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,I'm fully aware that the odds are stacked against us. But I don't want to give up.

English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"Well, I suppose... With the situation as it is now, we can't accomplish what we came here for."
