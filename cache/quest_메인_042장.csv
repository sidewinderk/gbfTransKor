English,"scene_cp42_q4_s10,4241",detail,Vyrn,A safe place? You mean you're not going to the Crew of Enforcers headquarters?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s10,4241",detail,Lecia,I'll explain that too. But for now let's just go.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",synopsis,,"The crew head further into the outskirts of the city, where there are fewer soldiers but more monsters."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,,"With Lecia guiding them, [플레이어] and the crew move farther and farther from the center of town."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Katalina,"I don't see any soldiers out here, but there are more than enough monsters to make up for their absence."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Lecia,"True, but don't let your guard down. The empire's placed soldiers in every little nook and cranny of this island."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Katalina,What? You make it sound as if the empire is occupying Amalthea...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Lecia,...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s20,4242",detail,Rackam,Yep... I think I'm starting to see the bigger picture here. This island's definitely in a crisis.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",synopsis,,"Once safely inside the hideout, Lecia divulges what's happened on Amalthea. The crew agrees to back her up in exchange for potential information concerning Vyrn's origins."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,Lecia eventually brings the crew to a small cabin out in the woods.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Skyfarer 1,Captain Lecia! Good to see you safe and sound.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Skyfarer 2,"Captain... According to recon, the troops in the western forest have been almost completely wiped out..."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Understood. It's hard to get your hopes up in a situation like this.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Please report back to recon and tell them to check the emergency bunkers throughout the island.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"Among them, old abandoned-looking ones take the most precedence."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Word from HQ is that almost all of the newer bunkers have already been overrun with suppressive force.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Skyfarer 2,Yes ma'am!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Eugen,"Well... For the time bein', it looks like there aren't any enemies around here at least."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"So tell us, Lecia. What's happened here?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"Amalthea Island, headquarters of the Fourth Fleet of the Crew of Enforcers, is now being occupied by the Erste Empire."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"As you know, I left this island for a certain amount of time to visit Mephorash on Ravi Island."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"During my absence, the imperial army invaded Amalthea Island..."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"Wait. Even if you were absent, Monika was still here, wasn't she?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Yes. Monika helmed the Fourth Fleet's retaliation.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,However—
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,"They lost, right? Otherwise this wouldn't be happening right now?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,No way! We fought her when we were fleeing Amalthea!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,"She was small, but ridiculously strong!"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,Yes... I must admit it's hard to believe that Monika could lose so easily.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,I had my doubts too. I was sure that there was some kind of mistake.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,But it's all fact. And now Monika is imprisoned in the Fourth Hall jail.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,Insanity... How did this happen?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,I can explain that part...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,The elderly skyfarer steps forward to address the crew.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,"When the empire invaded, Captain Lecia was absent, but Deputy Captain Monika was here on the island."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,"So we weren't worried. We were all certain that no matter what happened, we couldn't lose."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,But the imperial commander... I'm not certain if I should say...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Eugen,"Hey now... At this point, let's not hide anything else, all right?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Please continue. We can trust these people.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,Very well... The imperial commander is Lieutenant General Gandharva.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Elderly Skyfarer,He was once a captain for the Crew of Enforcers.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,What? Then why would he...
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"By the time I joined the Crew of Enforcers, Gandharva had already been kicked out of the crew."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"So I read the files we had on him, and apparently he had overwhelming skill—rivaling even Monika's power."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"But he was exceedingly violent and arrogant, and he refused to accept any consequences for his actions."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"He was at the top of the crew. But after he fought and lost to the Blue Knight in a duel, he was exiled from our crew, never to be seen on this island again."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,"This guy thought he'd pay a little visit to his former home now that he's the empire's lieutenant general, eh?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Io,S-such a powerful guy's out there right now?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"After defeating Monika, he took over the Fourth Hall as the lieutenant general of the imperial army."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"So to summarize, he's hijacked your headquarters, and the remaining forces are still resisting."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Vyrn,Whoa now... This is startin' to sound more serious than I coulda imagined!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,I'm fully aware that the odds are stacked against us. But I don't want to give up.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lyria,"Psst, [플레이어]..."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",sel1_txt,,We'll help you.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",sel2_txt,,Good luck with that!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Huh?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lyria,"That's right! As fellow skyfarers, we can't abandon you in a situation like this!"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Sigh... Th-thank you... I'll do my best.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lyria,"No! [플레이어], that's not what I meant..."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lyria,Don't you think we could help Lecia and her crew?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"Well, I suppose... With the situation as it is now, we can't accomplish what we came here for."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Speaking of... Why did you come to Amalthea?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,Katalina explains to Lecia what's happened since they parted ways on Ravi Island.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"What, no way... I can't believe the prime minister would do such a thing..."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Katalina,"So you see, we need information."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Information on that winged lizard? Would we even have anything like that?
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,"Well, the Fourth Hall archive does contain all kinds of reference material from all over the Skydoms."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,Great! Then that settles it!
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Rackam,"We help you guys out with your infestation problem, and you guys help us gather info. Deal?"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lecia,Uhh... I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,Lyria,"Great! I think we'll get along well, Lecia!"
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,"Lyria and Lecia exchange a smile, solidifying the temporary alliance between the Grandcypher's crew and the Enforcers."
English,"scene_cp42_q4_s30,4243",detail,,Little do they know that the bond they have just formed will go on to cause reverberations throughout the Phantagrande Skydom.
