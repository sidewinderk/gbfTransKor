English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",synopsis,,Rosetta runs off to watch over the Grandcypher. The rest of the crew discusses her mysterious nature.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rosetta,I'm off to keep an eye on the Grandcypher.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rosetta,Call for me if something happens. I'll be right there.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Vyrn,What's the deal with Rosetta?
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Io,"She does seem a little suspicious. Hey, [Djeeta], what do you think?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",sel1_txt,,Maybe she found an acquaintance of hers?
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",sel2_txt,,She may be hiding something on the ship.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rackam,"Rosetta? Acquaintances in Golonzo? Well, it's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard..."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rackam,"But if she ran away from us, it means she doesn't want us to come face to face with 'em."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rackam,There shouldn't be any hidden rooms on the Grandcypher.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Rackam,But I guess you could make a hiding space by cutting a hole somewhere. We should be careful.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Katalina,"Maybe it's a little late to say this, but everything about Rosetta is a little too mysterious."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Eugen,What's the big deal? Everybody's got somethin' they're hiding.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Io,"There's a lot of stuff we don't know about her yet, but I don't think she's a bad person."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Lyria,That's right! I don't think so either!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Katalina,"Haha. She's given me no reason to trust her, but I have the same feeling as you both."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Monster,Groar!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s20,2542",detail,Eugen,"Well, well, how about we focus on fightin' our enemies rather than doubtin' our friends."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",synopsis,,"A mysterious boy appears before the crew. Not long after, the prime minister of the Erste Empire intercepts the crew as well."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Rackam,Five whole days... Sigh...
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Eugen,That's what we get for overworkin' the poor ship. Be glad it's not a solid month.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Rackam,"Yeah, yeah. You're right."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Rackam,"[Djeeta], after the Grandcypher's all fixed up, which island are we headed to?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Katalina,"To leave Phantagrande Skydom, we're going to have to collect the missing pieces of the sky map."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Lyria,But I want to speak with Orchis one more time...
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Lyria,We couldn't even say goodbye to her in Lumacie.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Lyria,And... I have to know what I really am!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,"That is something you will come to learn in time, Lyria. You have nothing to worry about."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,But forget that for now. It's still too soon to worry about what will happen after your stay on this island.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Eugen,"You there, boy... Who are you?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,"Oh my, Eugen, you haven't changed a bit. Oh, and Rackam, it's been quite a long time."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Rackam,"Huh? Sorry, but do I know you?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,I suppose you were awfully young. But your eyes haven't changed. That's comforting.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,"That said, the promise will soon—"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Katalina,"Young man, sorry to interrupt, but what did you mean by too soon to leave a moment ago?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,I meant exactly what I said. The Grandcypher can't leave this island right now.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Eugen,We're all too aware of that. The repairs she's undergoin' are still gonna take some time.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,No. That's not quite what I meant.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,"No matter what you do to the Grandcypher, it won't be able to leave the island. So long as the promise remains unfulfilled."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Io,The promise? What's that s'posed to mean?
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,"Io Euclase, you will refrain from asking any further questions."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,The Erste Empire will not permit you or the rest of your rabble to pry into this boy's statements.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Katalina,Who goes—No... It can't be!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,"I am Freesia von Bismarck, Prime Minister of the Erste Empire."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,"You, skyfarer with the red lizard. You are the captain of this crew?"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,The Erste Empire demands that you and your riffraff return our research property. Hand over Lyria.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Eugen,Guess it was a matter of time until we finally ran into the empire... So what happened to the Black Knight?
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Pommern,Th-there is no need for you to know that.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Pommern,You should be more worried about yourselves!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Pommern,"We'll have our revenge, and you'll return Lyria to the empire, Lieutenant Katalina!"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Lyria,Katalina... [Djeeta]...
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Katalina,"Prime Minister, my apologies, but we have no intention of giving up Lyria. I humbly ask you to reconsider..."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,Sigh... Why must you make things difficult... Capture that boy!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Imperial Soldier,Yes ma'am!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,???,Now isn't this an irritating predicament.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Vyrn,What are you doing! He's got nothin' to do with us!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,I believe I heard that your little airship will remain grounded here no matter what you do.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,"A caged rat requires no chasing, so we'll take our time with you."
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Freesia,"Instead we shall take custody of this boy, who seems to know so much about you. <span class='scene-font-italic'>Take him away!</span>"
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Imperial Soldier,Yes ma'am!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,Io,Hey! Wait a minute! What are you doing!
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,,The mysterious boy lets out a cry as the imperial soldiers drag him away.
English,"scene_cp25_q4_s30,2543",detail,,[Djeeta] is left standing there petrified by the unexpected turn of events.
