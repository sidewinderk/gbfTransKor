English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Ferry,Huh?
English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Rosetta,Oh dear! But something's coming closer!
English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Monster,Groooar!
English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Io,It's just a regular old monster! There's no way that's Celeste!
English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Ferry,But why? This is definitely the same place as before...
English,"scene_cp23_q1_s20,2312",detail,Katalina,"Either way, this thing answered our call. So let's fight it back! Here we go, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",synopsis,,"Thinking that something else may be needed to summon Celeste, everyone decides to go talk to the villagers in hopes of getting some clues."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",detail,Ferry,What am I doing wrong? The place and everything should be the same as back then...
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",detail,Rosetta,There's a lot we don't know about primal beasts. Perhaps there's something else we need that you don't know about.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",detail,Katalina,Sounds like we need some clues first. Like whether something else on the island was odd when Celeste arrived.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",detail,Lyria,Let's go ask the villagers! There might be someone who remembers something!
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s10,2321",detail,Vyrn,We were planning on going to see them anyway! So let's head on over!
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",synopsis,,"The villagers welcome Ferry with open arms. They explain that before Celeste appeared, an illness began to spread right when a traveling doctor came to the village. But the doctor has disappeared."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,,"When they arrive at the village, [Djeeta] and the crew tell the villagers about Ferry's decision."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 1,"I see, I see... How wonderful! You've made the right decision, Ferry!"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 2,"So our existence here is coming to an end, eh? Looking back, it's been a mighty long time. But it still feels like yesterday..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 3,"Ferry, weren't you lonely all this time in that mansion by yourself?"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Ferry,"Well, I mean... I had monsters to keep me company..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 3,"Is that so? Well, from now on, if you're ever in trouble, you'd better come and tell us, all right?"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Ferry,Yes! I will.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 3,Mm-hmm! That's a good girl!
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Lyria,"You look sort of nervous, Ferry, but really happy too!"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Katalina,Indeed. I guess this clears up any rumors or misunderstandings.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,,[Djeeta] and the crew ask whether the villagers know of anything odd around the time Celeste first appeared.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 1,Something odd? I can't think of anything...
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 3,"Let's see... Now that you mention it, an illness began to spread through the island around the time Celeste appeared, I think."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 2,Not exactly. The illness was already running rampant before the primal beast came.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 2,"A traveling doctor showed up right around the same time, but the doctor couldn't do anything in the end..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Io,"Hm... An illness and a doctor, huh? Neither of those seem helpful here..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Rosetta,Would you happen to know where that doctor is now?
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 1,Hm? That's a good question... Hasn't been around the village at any rate.
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 3,"Perhaps the doctor left the island on an airship. The doctor never stayed in one place, after all..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Villager 2,"Zombie or ghost, we haven't seen any sign of the doctor on the island since."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Rosetta,"Disappeared without a trace, I see..."
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Vyrn,"Whoa! There's a monster! Come on, [Djeeta]!"
English,"scene_cp23_q2_s20,2322",detail,Vyrn,Ferry's just warming up to the villagers! No way we're gonna let these stinkers drop in on the party!
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",synopsis,,"The villagers say that when Celeste appeared, there'd been a spreading illness and a traveling doctor on the island. But the connection to the primal beast is still unclear. Thinking that the doctor could be the key, everyone decides to visit the house where the doctor lived."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Vyrn,"So let's sum up what we heard from the villagers, okay?"
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Vyrn,"When Celeste appeared, the only unusual things on the island were a spreading illness and a traveling doctor!"
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Katalina,But I just don't see a connection between those things and primal beasts...
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Lyria,Hm... I don't see it either.
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Ferry,Too bad the doctor couldn't stop the illness from spreading...
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Rosetta,"Doctors aren't perfect, you know! But perhaps that doctor left clues behind about a cure."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Io,"According to the villagers, the doctor lived near the cemetery."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s10,2331",detail,Io,"There might be something there, so let's go take a look, [Djeeta]!"

English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Katalina,Is that a summoning circle?
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Io,What does this mean? Could it be that the doctor was fake and was really a mage all along?
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,Hmmm... You're close! But it sounds more like the person was both a doctor <span class='scene-font-italic'>and</span> a mage...
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Vyrn,Hey! When did you get here? And why did you come?
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,"Well, you see... There's something about this hub-bub that's been naggin' me in the back of my mind."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,"And I think it's buggin' you too, [Djeeta]... Am I right?"
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",sel1_txt,,You mean about the primal beast?
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",sel2_txt,,You mean about Ferry?

English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,"Wrong answer, but you're not far off. I'll give you that!"
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,But at least we're both thinking that something seems off about all this...
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,"Say, Ferry, didn't you say you made a wish and it reached the primal beast Celeste?"
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Ferry,"Right! Because of my wish, Celeste came to this island."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Drang,"Yep, yep! But if you ask me, I think you've got it all wrong..."
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Ferry,What?
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Vyrn,What're you trying to say? Stop beatin' around the bush already!
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Sturm,Wait. We've got company first. There are monsters coming this way.
English,"scene_cp23_q3_s20,2332",detail,Sturm,"Get ready, [Djeeta]. And keep your eyes peeled, or I'll peel 'em for you!"
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",synopsis,,"Drang thinks someone else summoned Celeste. As if confirming his suspicion, a ghost suddenly appears. Lyria senses that the ghost is similar to a primal beast."
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Drang,Isn't it a little naïve to think that a primal beast would answer a random wish?
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Drang,"If you wanted to control a primal without being an Astral, you'd need to be pretty smart or pretty special. Am I right?"
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Rosetta,Indeed. That's exactly why the empire's been so fascinated with Lyria and her powers.
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Katalina,"In other words, you're saying that it wasn't Ferry, but a different culprit who summoned Celeste?"
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Drang,Bingo! What do you think? Did I get it right?
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Drang,"Did I, <span class='scene-font-italic'>Mister Culprit?</span>"
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,???,...
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Ferry,What's that! Where did it come from?
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s10,2341",detail,Lyria,"[Djeeta], I know that's a ghost, but I'm sensing something similar to a primal beast..."

English,"scene_cp23_q4_s20,2342",detail,Ferry,Experiments? So he never intended to treat the illness...
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s20,2342",detail,Rosetta,We can't say for sure. It looks like he certainly had some skills as a doctor...
English,"scene_cp23_q4_s20,2342",detail,Rosetta,"The only thing we can say is that whatever his research was, he's the result."

English,"scene_cp23_q4_s20,2342",detail,Drang,Who knows? I sure don't. And there's no way to tell anymore.
